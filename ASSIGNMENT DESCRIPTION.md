World famous astrologer Lolita needs a Horoscope-as-a-Service (HaaS) application,
because she is tired of doing all these complex astrological calculations by hand.
Using Laravel and SQL database of your choice, create an application that:

  1. Generates horoscopes for all 12 Zodiac signs for a given year. Each sign can have
  from 1 (really shitty day) to 10 (super amazing day).
  2. Day scores are generated randomly for each day and stored in the database.
  3. Shows a calendar for a given year and Zodiac sign.
  4. Days should be colored from #ff0000 (really shitty) to #00ff00 (super amazing).
  5. Shows the best month on average (by score) for a Zodiac sign in a given year.
  6. Shows which Zodiac sign has the best year (by score)

**BONUS POINTS: Generate a sentence that describes what happens to an astrological
sign on a given day. Sentence should make sense, be relevant to the score of the day (1 -
10), and should not be repetitive.
